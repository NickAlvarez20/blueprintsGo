## Project Name
BluePrints Go
## About
This repository contains a collection of Go functions designed as warm-up exercises to practice core programming concepts. The project includes functions for string manipulation, arithmetic operations, pointer usage, and conditional logic, serving as a foundation for learning Go.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need Go installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This BluePrints Go includes these features:

-helloWorld: Returns the string "Hello, World!"

-addSum: Calculates the sum of two integers

-evenOrOdd: Determines if a number is "Even" or "Odd"

-largestNumber: Returns the larger of two numbers

-areaOfSquare: Calculates the area of a square given its side length

-lengthString: Returns the length of a given string, handling empty strings

-swapValues: Swaps two integers using pointers

-repeatString: Repeats a string a specified number of times

-firstCharacter: Returns the first character of a string, handling empty strings

-positiveNumber: Checks if a number is positive or zero

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/blueprintsGo.git`
## Usage
Run the Go script (main.go) from the command line: 

`go run test.go`

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master Go's syntax for functions, pointers, and conditionals

-Understand string and integer manipulation in Go

-Develop problem-solving skills through simple algorithmic exercises
